# SnakeInPython
Game of Snake written in python 3.X using classes

Hello welcome to snake coded in python. This was a project course that I followed along with from the youtuber BROCODE. I ended up learning a lot from this tutorial I really like how he implemented the snake as well as the food/apple as classes then used tk to draw them on the canvas. Also the use of constants throughout the code was a really cool idea, it really helped keep everything consistent throughout the project it also gives the user a way to adjust settings and debug the code. Also the use of lambdas with binding keys so you can use the change direction function was also a cool idea.

your goal is to collect the red apples to grow your snake, when you eat the apples your snakes 
length will increase by one and your score will increase as well the more you eat the longer you get.
